Every day and every week, AhaSlides welcomes more and more new users to our application. This increase in numbers brings us great joy and validates the hard work we've put in. However, we also find ourselves questioning the significance of these numbers. Do all of these users actively engage with AhaSlides? In other words, do they create presentations and run them, or do they simply create an account and remain inactive? We aim to leverage the user data stored in our database to find answers to these questions.

One key aspect we seek to understand is user loyalty. How can we measure the loyalty of our users, and what factors can be used to gauge this? With SQL, we can craft queries to analyze user behavior and determine their level of engagement with our platform. By identifying patterns in user activity, such as frequency of logins, creation of presentations, and interaction with features, we can gain insights into their loyalty to our platform. This information will be invaluable in informing our strategies for user retention and satisfaction.
